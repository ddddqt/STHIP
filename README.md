### Project Introduction

This project proposes a method for complex interaction modeling in behavior recognition, enhancing the model's understanding of interactions between individuals and the environment, as well as between individuals themselves. Our approach effectively reduces redundancy while retaining important features, improving action recognition accuracy.

### Code Release Note
